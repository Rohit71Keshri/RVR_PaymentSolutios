# RVR_PaymentSolutios
Payment solutions for the merchants and Delivery company.

 
Our Solution : 

We will have an application/portal for the merchant. There the merchant will have to create an account with delivery company. While registering, they have to give their bank account details. Merchant can log in and manage their accounts with the help of this app/portal. So, whatever amount the delivery company gets from the customers, the same amount of virtual money will be added to the merchant's account. The merchant shall be able to request the delivery company to withdraw their virtual money. Here withdrawing money means requesting the delivery company to transfer the virtual money to their(merchant's) bank account. The delivery company has to transfer the requested amount to the merchant to their bank accounts.

To collect the cash from the customer, the delivery guy will have a mobile app which he/she will carry. He/she has to enter the order number and all the details for the order will come up. Now, the payment can be done by cash or by swiping the card. After successful payment, the delivery guy has to confirm the payment through the app. The same amount of virtual money will be credited to the merchant's account at the same time.
